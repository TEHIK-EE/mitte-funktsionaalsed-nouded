| The document defines the quality and non-functional requirements (NFRs) for new information systems and their documentation. The document is maintained by the architects of the Health and Welfare Information Systems Centre (TEHIK).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |     |     |     |     |
| The document must be viewed as the principal document for quality and non-functional requirements for developments. In case of discrepancies between the principal document and the documents referred to, the descriptions set out in the principal document must be adhered to. In case of discrepancies between documents prepared by TEHIK and those prepared by third parties referenced in the principal document, the specifications in the TEHIK documents must be adhered to. |     |     |     |     |
| If any requirement cannot be fulfilled or is impractical, the reason and justification for non-compliance must be provided in the tender submission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |     |     |     |
